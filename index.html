        <p class="content-item__text">Each week, couples are assigned a style of dance and a song. The professionally trained dancer (pro) is then in charge of cherographing a unique and captivating dance as well as responsible for teaching their celebrity partner how todo the dance. The judges will then score on technique, style, difficulty, and performance. Each judge will give a score 1-10 resulting in a total out of 30. During the show, the audience and audience at home can vote for each couple 10 times per voting method (text, website, app). The score out of 30 from the judges and votes from America are totaled, and the couple with the lowest combined total is sent home.</p>
